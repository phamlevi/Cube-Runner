This is short game that I worked on in my free time. It is called Cube Runner and the main objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible while dodging obstacles. Further instructions are in the "Option" button, be sure to check it out before you play. This project is heavily inspired by Brackeys's tutorials for studying purposes, more information about this can be found [here](https://brackeys.com/).
